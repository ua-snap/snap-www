	<td>Since 2008, SNAP has teamed up with the Alaska Center for Climate Change Adaptation and Policy (ACCAP) to provide Alaskans with the climate change science and understanding required to effectively plan for the future and the inherent uncertainties of what lies ahead. This collaborative approach has not only yielded significant benefit for Alaska stakeholders, but has also enabled SNAP and ACCAP to leverage resources to the benefit of both organizations while preserving programmatic independence. SNAP and ACCAP collaborate on multiple projects that are currently funded through the next 3-5 years. These projects help to: (1) strengthen collaborative ties between the two programs, which increases leveraging power, and (2) build capacity to develop, analyze, and communicate climate change data, research, and information.</td>
