Note on adding new Javascript files to this project:

The Javascript is minified & packaged in the makefile for this project.  The makefile is invoked during the build process on Jenkins.

If you add a new javascript file, follow these steps:

- Include it in the src/Template.php class in Template::getHeadJavascript() function, between the
<!-- package-javascript -->
and
<!-- end-package -->
comment flags.

- Add it to the right part of the makefile:
-- if it's custom-written javascript, put it in the section marked # ** custom SNAP javascript belongs here
-- if it's a vendor script, put it in the section marked # ** vendor (3rd party) javascript belongs here

Custom-written JS is minified, vendor JS is whitespace-minified, and all are bundled together into a single file.
